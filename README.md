## Overview of project 
Louise is an upcoming play writer who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play "Fever" for which she is estimating a budget of $10,000. She wants our help to determine whether there are specific factors that makes project campaigns successful. We will be analyzing and sorting a crowdfunding data to determine the same.

### Purpose
We need to provide a visualized feedback to Lousie with insights to help her gain a better understanding of the campaign from start to finish so that she will be able to set her campaign to mirror other successful one's in the same category.

## Analysis and Challenges
