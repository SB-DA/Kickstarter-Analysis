# Kickstarter-Analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter dataset to uncover trends based on specific factors that makes project campaigns successful.

## Overview of project 
Louise is an upcoming play writer who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play "Fever" for which she is estimating a budget of $10,000. She wants our help to determine whether there are specific factors that makes project campaigns successful. We will be analyzing and sorting a crowdfunding data to determine the same.

## Purpose
We need to provide a visualized feedback to Louise with insights to help her gain a better understanding of the campaign from start to finish so that she will be able to set her campaign to mirror other successful one's in the same category.

## Analysis and Challenges 
By taking an initial look at the raw data we figured it had to be sorted and prepared for the analysis by creating a new column to show Percentage funded, Average Donation, split categories and subcategories,coverted dates and also creating a new column for year of Launched date.

- Below chart is based on the Outcomes of the Parent Category. This chart cleary tells Theater was the most successful overall. We further filtered it to see the United states and Great Britain campaigns . US had 525 successful theater kickstarters and GB had a total of 258 successful theater kickstarters.

- Below chart is based on the Subcategory Outcomes. And it helps us to conculde that the subcategory "Plays" is the most successful of all. There were 412 successful Plays in US and 238 in GB.

- Below chart is based on the overall outcomes on Launched Dates. The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was in May. However, January, June, July and October all had similar number of failed campaigns launched.

To continue to help Louise plan her campaign, we will have to be more specific with the searches . Even though Plays under the Theater category was the most successful over a period of time. We might have to determine more details to make her upcoming Play Fever to be a successful campaign.



## Kickstarter Challenge
Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. We have to determine how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals by visualizing campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date - Theater
By creating below line graph we can see a detailed trend. May and June had relatively high number of Successful theater campaigns and December had the least. So its good to say that the Play should be launched during May or June.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Below Line chart helps us to understand that Goals less than $1000 was 76% successful and most of the unsuccessful campaigns were around $45000 - $49999. Goals around $10000 - $14999 were 54% successful and 46% failed.

#### Difficulties and Challenges Encountered 
 - Firstly, the dataset had to be sorted and organzied to start the basic analysis.
 - We had to further refine the searches using filters and updating the chart to view certain results.
 - Had to experiment with the Pivot table and Charts and faced some formula errors which I had to learn and rectify.
 
 
 #### Conclusions Drawn from the Outcomes based on Launch Date 
 - Launching the campaign at a right time is important for it be successful.
 - The Lenght of the campaign can also be important to analyse.
 
 
#### Conclusions Drawn from the Outcomes based on Goals
- As per the data gathered we can conclude that Louise's goal had a 54% chance of it being successful.
- Having a considerable high goal can also effect the campaign.


#### Limitations of Dataset
- Information on Genre of plays would have been helpful in determining the success of plays and give better analysis to Louise. 
- US and UK are the countries were most of the plays were successful. If we had more information about the cities and the age group of people going and watching the play would have been intresting to see.
- The dataset is from the year range - 2009 till 2017. If we had information about current data. We could have analyzed current trends.


#### Other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create
- A clustered column chart can be used to show the outcomes based on Launched Date.
- A stacked column, Clustered column chart can be used to show Outcomes base don goals .
