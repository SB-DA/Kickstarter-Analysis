# Kickstarter-Analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter dataset to uncover trends based on specific factors that make project campaigns successful.

## Overview of project 
Louise is an upcoming play writer who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play "Fever" for which she is estimating a budget of $10,000. She wants our help to determine whether there are specific factors that makes project campaigns successful. We will be analyzing and sorting a crowdfunding data to determine the same.

### Purpose
We need to provide a visualized feedback to Lousie with insights to help her gain a better understanding of the campaign from start to finish so that she will be able to set her campaign to mirror other successful one's in the same category.

## Analysis and Challenges 
By taking an initial look at the raw data we figured it had to be sorted and prepared for the analysis by creating a new column to show Percentage funded, Average Donation, Split the categories to show Parent and Subcategories and coverted the dates and also created a new column for year of Launched date.

- Below chart is based on the Outcomes of the Parent Category. This chart cleary tells Theater was the most successful overall. We further filtered it to see the United states and Great Britain campaigns . US had 525 successful theater kickstarters and GB had a total of 258 successful theater kickstarters.

To continue to help Louise plan her campaign, we will have to be more specific with the searches . Even though Plays under the Theater category was the most successful over a period of time. We might have to determine more details to make her upcoming Play Fever to be a successful campaign.



## Kickstarter Challenge
Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. We have to determine how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals by visualizing campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date 
By creating below line graph we can see a detailed trend. May and June had relatively high number of Successful theater campaigns and December had the least. So its good to say that the Play should be launched during May or June.
